I want to finish, delete entry, entry filter, entry name, entry username, and ok, ok, back to this, current user, compose a list of entries Ok, so, current user, user.entries, yes, that's good Oops, that seems to be right, max of all this, and 4 Why does it need brackets here? But it actually gave me... Ok, a list, because of max, it checks... Ok, fine I don't think that matters that much Ah, that's why you have a plus sign there, because you added to the list And then, you just find the max of that in this list, ok, we got those two done And then, instead of this, maybe we can call it string First we pad this, yes, that's the first line, but are we padding to the front or to the back? So front equals true, when front equals true, we're padding it to the front Ok, when front equals true, we're padding it to the front First we have two spaces, and then we are padding it at the back So we can't have a handheld mouse here Ah, that's bad And then, two more spaces, info, pad it to the back Also false, pad does, but do that, ok, that looks good, this is the first string And then, wait, just... That's fine Text, total length, yes, that looks fine Ok, because we actually do need that I don't want to do this, but I want to look at what options I have String with add, of course we can't do string with Two spaces, entry name, end name, and we are padding it at the front And you know what? We can just actually edit this, because this, we know that this is true Add two spaces And info, true This is at the front And two spaces I don't know if this works, I will assume that this works With spaces, but this is wrong 28, so... Let's just hardcode this Two spaces, that means 1, 2, 3 That looks alright
