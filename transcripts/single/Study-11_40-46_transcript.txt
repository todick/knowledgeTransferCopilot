User objects, session.scalars. Wait, now I'm under, okay, so they filter that thing and then they say scalars list. Look, why are not we reading? Look, list of user objects. They are doing already for us. This scalars all. It's the list of the user subjects. Yeah, okay, so this is of type. I want to check the type of this thing. Yes, maybe. If it's a Python list, then we are done. I mean, you can just check the all. Query for individual columns. This we don't need. So can we say if len of user underscore object equals zero? Equals zero, no, double. Oh no, double this. Oh, wait. Oh my God. Wait, wait, double, no, no, no, here. Equals zero, session.add. Session.add. Session.add. What is it? User with password. How do we name? Equal name. Now we need to give it an ID as well. Password equal password and ID equal. Ah, it's going to hash it. Apparently. We have some hash password for this one. Wait, did they say what we hash for the ID? Unique identifier for the database. Unique identifier for the database. ID. Let's hash the name. No, the password. Let's hash the password. Nope, doesn't like it. Why is it ID? I don't know. Why do you even use ID there? I put ID and it gave me that. Because, no, sorry, ID equal ID. I did that, look. Okay, and then? Build in. I mean, we can just use that, right? ID and with an empty. I don't think we can use random. Yeah, right, because we need to know it. I think we just use ID with empty brackets. Just like that? Yeah, I think so. Ah, yeah, you're right, you're right. Now we still need entries of the object, and then entries this one. But yeah, this function then is done. Right? If the list is empty, then we add a user. Then we add a user. If not, we don't do anything. Yes, I think, wait, but don't we need to hash the password? Wait, this is list of row objects. No, that one is from earlier. We can delete it, I think. I think this one, we should hash them first with this one. You're right. Hash password. Then call the password this. I think this. Nice, nice, nice. Yeah, this doesn't like this. All right, good. Now we- Wait, do we need this? No, but yeah, we don't need it. You're right. Okay, login. What do we want to do with login? Check whether a user and password exists. Ah, okay, this is basically the same logic. Right? I think so. Ah, and a password. No, it changes a bit. Oh, shit. Wait, what happened? Control Z. Oh, cancel. Wait, what? I mean, we can just do this. Oh, wrong one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, okay, so here we have a list of objects. If the length is zero, then we return. What do we return? The user object, else none. Okay, return none because the user does not exist. Otherwise-
